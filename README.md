# hello-world
The first test of GitHub

Hello, my name is Devin Franke. I am a teenager from the beautiful city of Ventura, California.
Growing up, I have always had a passion for technology. Anything that had electricity, software, or buttons, I wanted to learn all about it and become knowledgeable
It was only recently where I have started wanting to learn about the inner workings of all the content that goes in to it, and thats mainly code and program to make it run.
I was just recently offered an amazing opportunity at JLM Strategic Talent Partners, and I am looking forward to seeing how I can help.
This year I took an entire coure on Structured Programming, mainly focused on C++. I will try and post as many coding projects as I can on here, so that they are all made available.
I hope you enjoy my work.

- Devin :)
